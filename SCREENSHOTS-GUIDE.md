## 🖼️ Image Optimization Tips

1. **Crop appropriately** - Remove unnecessary browser chrome, focus on content
2. **Consistent sizing** - Try to keep similar aspect ratios
3. **Clear text** - Ensure all text is readable in the screenshots
4. **Highlight features** - Show the key functionality of each project

## 🔄 Updating Screenshots

1. Add your screenshots to the appropriate folders
2. Keep the same file names as specified in the project data
3. The modal will automatically display your new screenshots
4. Test by clicking "View" buttons in the Projects section

## 🎨 Using the Placeholder Generator

If you don't have screenshots yet, you can use the `generate-placeholders.html` file:

1. Open `generate-placeholders.html` in your browser
2. Edit the `currentProject` variable for different projects
3. Take screenshots of the generated placeholder
4. Use these as temporary screenshots until you have real ones

## ✅ Current Screenshot Paths

The modal expects these exact file paths:

```javascript
// AI Financial Segmentation
"/screenshots/ai-financial-segmentation/dashboard.png"
"/screenshots/ai-financial-segmentation/analytics.png" 
"/screenshots/ai-financial-segmentation/results.png"

// E-Commerce BuyFLOW
"/screenshots/ecommerce-buyflow/homepage.png"
"/screenshots/ecommerce-buyflow/product-catalog.png"
"/screenshots/ecommerce-buyflow/cart.png"
"/screenshots/ecommerce-buyflow/checkout.png"

// And so on for other projects...
```

## 🚀 Testing

After adding screenshots:
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to the Projects section
3. Click "View" on any project card
4. The modal should open with your screenshots
5. Use arrow keys or thumbnail navigation to browse images

**Note**: If images don't load, check the file paths and ensure the images are in the `public/screenshots/` folder with the exact names specified in the project data.
